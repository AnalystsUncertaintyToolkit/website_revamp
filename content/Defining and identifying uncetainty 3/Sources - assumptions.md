Considering the assumptions you’re making in your analysis is critical to any uncertainty analysis

Assumptions are used when we have incomplete knowledge. All models will require some assumptions, so you need to ensure that assumptions are robust and consistently understood. You should use an assumptions log with quality and impact RAG ratings and they should be signed off by stakeholders. Where did the assumptions come from? How were they generated and why? What is the impact if they are wrong, and how often are they reviewed?

Consider where you have used assumptions

There are often parameters outside of the scope of the model that have been implicitly assumed. For example, models may assume no substantial policy changes in related areas and there may be deliberate limits in the coverage or timelines of your analysis – deliberate modelling exclusions that allow timely and effective analysis. These assumptions and limitations provide the context in which the modelling results are appropriate. You need to be aware of the restrictions that these assumptions impose on the interpretation of analytical results and take care to explain where modelling results can (and cannot) be used.

What assumptions are outside the scope of the model?

Assumptions should be based on robust evidence. The less evidence to support an assumption the more uncertain it will be. High quality assumptions will be underpinned by robust data, while low quality assumptions may simply be an opinion or may be supported by a poor data source.

Assess the quality of each assumption

The importance of an assumption is measured by its effect on the on the analytical output. The higher the impact of an assumption the more uncertain results will be. Critical assumptions will drastically affect the results, while less importance assumptions may only have a marginal effect on results. More weight should be given to gathering evidence to improve the quality of critical assumptions.

Assess the impact of each assumption

Some uncertainties can’t be captured in an assumption as we don’t have perfect insight. However, effort should be made to identify all possible uncertainties and capture these as assumptions. The assumptions log will convey the boundary of what has been included.
