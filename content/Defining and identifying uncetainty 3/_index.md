Analytical uncertainty can feed through into analysis and subsequent decision making from many different sources.

We encounter uncertainty throughout the decision making process and in the analysis which supports it. In addition to uncertainties around the analytical question, we will also find uncertainty in the context of the decision being made, the data and assumptions feeding into the analysis and in the analysis itself. As analysts we need to understand and describe contextual uncertainties to ensure our analysis has impact; and we need to describe and quantify analytical uncertainties to ensure decision makers are clear about how far analytical results can be used to support their conclusions.

Early identification is important. Try to identify and record all the potential sources of uncertainty in your analysis at an early stage. Early identification of uncertainty is important; if you overlook a potential source of uncertainty this could reduce the usefulness and impact of your subsequent analysis. See the presenting and communicating uncertainty section for Tornado diagrams that are a useful way to communicate the size of uncertainty.

This section sets out a range of techniques to help you understand and assess the sources of uncertainty in your analysis.
