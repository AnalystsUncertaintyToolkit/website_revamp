There are a number of ways to classify uncertainty. A common classification divides uncertainty into known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns, as we explain in Table 3.1. Other classifications consider, for example, the range of things about the analysis which may be uncertain and whether uncertainty relates directly to these “objects” of uncertainty or to the quality of evidence behind them. We recommend following one of these frameworks when assessing the uncertainties that affect your analysis and the decisions it will inform.

*The following definitions can be used to distinguish between these forms of uncertainty:

Ontological Uncertainty concerns the degree of conceptual understanding that we have of ‘the world’. Following Lane (2005), this leads us to: ‘Grapple’ with the nature of the things we seek to analyse The most appropriate form of their characterisation for a stated purpose The appropriate interpretation of analysis relating to these things See also, Mingers (2011)

While naively, ontological uncertainty can be said to be unknowable, we can turn this difficulty on its head through engaging with the ongoing challenge to understand the nature of the world around us. A way of achieving this is described in National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (2019, particularly pp 27-54)

Structural Uncertainty relates to the simplifications we make to derive a ‘concrete’ representation of ‘the world’, from our conceptual understanding, for the purposes of our analysis. Following Bojke et. al.(2009), the focus of structural uncertainty is therefore upon: Relevant models for understanding systemic responses and interactions (which can include internalised mind models and underpinning beliefs, qualitative models and quantitative models) Relevant scenarios, since these represent the factors that shape the response space of a system and either bring or fail to bring key sub-systems into operation. Thus, while Ontological uncertainty focuses on our conceptual characterisation of ‘the world’, structural uncertainty relates to the relevance of our ‘concrete’ or internalised models and scenarios for our analysis.

Deep Uncertainty derives from the extent to which we can anticipate the nature of the problem space we will in future need to understand in order to conduct meaningful analysis. Where we cannot anticipate these future circumstances then a judgement is required on when a decision must be made by, with analysis conducted on the best available information to support necessary decision-making. See Bloemen et. al.(2019) for analytical approaches.
